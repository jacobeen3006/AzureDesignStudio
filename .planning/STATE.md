# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-21)

**Core value:** Design, observe, and change Azure from one workspace — canvas fidelity, live tenant truth, and gated execution are all first-class.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Land and Stabilize

## Current Position

Plan: 0 of 8 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-21 — Phase 1 planned: 8 sequential plans in 8 waves; plan-checker passed with 0 blockers

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- 2026-10-21: Phase order is land → reproducible build → server harness → data durability → identity/guardrails → bounds/payload → shell → verification/diagnostics → credential model → post-gate capabilities → signed MSIX. Shell starts in parallel with Phase 2.
- 2026-10-21: Publisher legal name and signing path are decided in Phase 1; the signed artifact is produced in Phase 11 so certificate procurement is not on the critical path.
- 2026-10-21: Data durability precedes guardrail tenant scoping — the tenant column needs the migration baseline, not a fourth hand-written DDL statement.
- 2026-10-21: Post-gate capabilities (POST) stay after the Trust Gate closes; no new UI surface before then.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: publisher legal name and Azure Artifact Signing eligibility are external; start them at phase entry.
- Phase 2: Desktop Release duration is unmeasured; the Windows job starts non-blocking and becomes blocking only after two green runs (BUILD-05).
- Phase 4: no SQL Server legacy-schema fixture exists yet; build it from the current bootstrap DDL before migration 2.
- Phase 6: the what-if token gate is in-process with two replicas; pin replicas to 1 for the pilot or move the gate to the database before load testing.
- Phase 11: packaged data-root behavior is inferred, not verified; spike it before packaging work starts.
